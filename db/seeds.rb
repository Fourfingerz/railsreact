People of a certain age and level of like life-experience believe they're immortal: 
college students and alcoholics/addicts are the worst: they deep-down believe they're 
exempt from the laws of physics and statistics that ironly govern everybody else. 
They'll piss and moan your ear off if somebody else fucks with the rules, but they 
don't deep down see themselves subject to them, the same rules. And they're 
constitutionally unable to learn from anybody else's experience: if some jaywalking 
B.U. student does get his car towed, your other student's or addict's response to this 
will be to ponder just what imponderable difference makes it possible for that other 
guy to get splattered or towed and not him, the ponderer. They never doubt the 
difference — they just ponder it. It's like a kind of idolatry of uniqueness.

'I read,' I say. 'I study and read. I bet I've read everything you've read. 
Don't think I haven't. I consume libraries. I wear out spines and ROM-drives. 
I do things like get in a taxi and say, "The library, and step on it." 
My instincts concerning syntax and mechanics are better than your own, 
I can tell, with due respect. But it transcends the mechanics. I'm not a machine. 
I feel and believe. I have opinions. Some of them are interesting. 
I could, if you'd let me, talk and talk. Let's talk about anything. 
I believe the influence of Kierkegaard on Camus is underestimated. 
I believe Dennis Gabor may very well have been the Antichrist. 
I believe Hobbes is just Rousseau in a dark mirror. 
I believe, with Hegel, that transcendence is absorption. 
I could interface you guys right under the table,' 
I say. 'I'm not just a creatus, manufactured, conditioned, bred for a function.'

Talent is its own expectation, Jim: you either live up to it or it waves a hankie, 
receding forever. Use it or lose it, he say over the newspaper. I'm…I'm just afraid of 
having a tombstone that says HERE LIES A PROMISING OLD MAN. Potential maybe worse than 
none, Jim. Than no talent to fritter in the first place, lying around guzzling because 
I haven't the balls to…God I'm I'm so sorry Jim. You don't deserve to see me like this. 
I'm so scared, Jim. I'm so scared of dying without ever really being seen. 
Can you understand? Are you enough of a big thin prematurely stooped young bespectacled man,
even with your whole life still ahead of you, to understand? Can you see I was giving it all I had?
